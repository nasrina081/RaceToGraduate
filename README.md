# RaceToGraduate
**Race to Graduate** is my Java Script-based final project for Google Code Next, featuring an engaging game where players aim to catch falling textbooks and good grades to graduate while avoiding the dreaded F's. As a graduating senior at the time of creation, this game serves as a personal tribute to the journey of completing my education.
