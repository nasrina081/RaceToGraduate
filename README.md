## About the Creator

I'm Nasrin Ali, a junior majoring in computer science at George Mason University. As a passionate techie and artist, I combined my love for programming and gaming to create this game.

I developed "Race to Graduate" as my final project for Google Code Next, infusing it with the joy and memories of graduation. The game is not only a tribute to my senior year but also an opportunity to share that experience with players of all ages.

Feel free to dive into the world of ["Race to Graduate"](https://race-to-.glitch.me/) and enjoy the journey to success!
